# Serverless Breakfast Wrap Feed Filter

**100% serverless, 100% free, zero infrastructure!**

This solution uses GitHub Actions to automatically filter the ABC News Daily podcast feed every hour and publish only "Breakfast Wrap" episodes.

## How It Works

```
GitHub Actions (runs hourly)
  â†“
Fetches ABC feed
  â†“
Filters for "Breakfast Wrap"
  â†“
Commits breakfast-wrap.xml to repo
  â†“
GitHub Pages serves the file
  â†“
PocketCast reads the feed
  â†“
Downloads audio directly from ABC
```

**No servers, no NAS, no docker containers needed!**

## Monitoring

### View Workflow Runs

Go to your repo â†’ "Actions" tab to see:
- When it last ran
- Whether it succeeded
- How many episodes were found
- Any errors

### Check Your Feed

Visit your feed URL in a browser to see the XML:
```
https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/breakfast-wrap-feed/breakfast-wrap.xml
```

## Configuration

### Change Update Frequency

The default schedule runs weekdays at 00:05 UTC, optimized for ABC's publication time (10am Australian Eastern Time = ~00:00 UTC with 5-minute buffer).

Edit `.github/workflows/update-feed.yml`:

```yaml
schedule:
  - cron: '5 0 * * 1-5'  # Weekdays 00:05 UTC (default - optimized!)
  # - cron: '5 0 * * *'  # Daily 00:05 UTC (if you want weekends too)
  # - cron: '0 1 * * *'  # Once daily at 01:00 UTC (safer buffer)
  # - cron: '0 */6 * * *'  # Every 6 hours (fallback option)
```

**Note:** Breakfast Wrap is published weekdays at 10am AEST/AEDT (00:00 UTC), so running weekdays with a 5-minute buffer is optimal!

### Change Filter Keyword

Edit `filter_feed.py`:

```python
FILTER_KEYWORD = "Breakfast Wrap"  # Change this
```

### Change Maximum Episodes

Edit `filter_feed.py`:

```python
MAX_EPISODES = 50  # Change this
```

## Troubleshooting

### Workflow not running

- Check Actions tab for errors
- Ensure repository is public
- Verify workflow file is in `.github/workflows/`

### Feed is empty

- Check Actions tab â†’ Latest run â†’ View logs
- Look for "Found: ..." in the output
- Verify the filter keyword matches episode titles

### Can't access feed URL

- Wait 2-3 minutes after enabling GitHub Pages
- Ensure repository is public
- Check Settings â†’ Pages shows "Your site is published at..."

### Feed not updating

- Check Actions tab â†’ verify runs are succeeding
- GitHub Actions may be delayed during high usage
- Manually trigger a run to test

## Manual Trigger

To update the feed immediately:

1. Go to Actions tab
2. Select "Update Breakfast Wrap Feed"
3. Click "Run workflow"
4. Click green "Run workflow" button

## Privacy

- This uses a **public** GitHub repository
- Anyone can see your feed file
- Episode metadata is public (from ABC)
- Audio files are hosted by ABC (not re-uploaded)
- PocketCast downloads directly from ABC servers

## Costs

**FREE tier includes:**
- 2000 GitHub Actions minutes/month
- This workflow uses ~1 minute per run
- Running weekdays only = ~20-22 runs/month
- **Well within free tier!** (uses only 1% of quota)

## Stopping the Feed

To stop updates:

1. Go to `.github/workflows/update-feed.yml`
2. Delete the `schedule:` section
3. Commit

The feed file will remain accessible but won't update.
