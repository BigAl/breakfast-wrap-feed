      <title>Breakfast Wrap: Can the Liberals afford to water down net-zero?</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Opposition Leader Sussan Ley has been facing internal tensions for months and now there are questions over how she'll handle splitting views within the party on whether to keep a commitment to net zero emissions by 2050. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Nationals' decided to formally abandon the target ahead of today's Coalition party room meeting. So you'll hear from a Coalition frontbencher ahead of the meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, major news overseas, the former chief lawyer for the Israeli military is in police custody after admitting she leaked a damaging video appearing to show soldiers abusing a Palestinian man in jail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We'll also cross to France, where prosecutors in Paris say the daring jewellery heist at the Louvre was carried out by petty criminals, not organised professionals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And you'll meet the man hoping to beat his father's sailing record - solo circumnavigating the globe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recap the morning's news, politics and global affairs with the Breakfast Wrap.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The National Party has scrapped its commitment to reach net zero emissions by 2050, but says it still wants to reduce emissions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It comes as its partner in the Coalition— the Liberal Party —  continues its review into energy policy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, US President Donald Trump says he has ordered the Pentagon to prepare for potential military action in Nigeria if it fails to crack down on the killing of Christians.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back home, a landmark new report has revealed around 65,000 First Nations' households which have prepaid supply arrangements are being disconnected up to 59 times per year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And the Australian music industry has launched a campaign to localise our streaming algorithms and highlight homegrown talent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recap the morning's news, politics and global affairs with the Breakfast Wrap.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The federal government's long-awaited overhaul of environmental approvals will be introduced to parliament today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But passage for the bills will be treacherous, with the Coalition calling it a &quot;handbrake on investment&quot;  and the Greens arguing it &quot;weakens environmental protection&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, we get the details on reports of paramilitary forces committing mass killings and other atrocities in the Sudanese city of el-Fasher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And we'll go inside an unprecedented corporate dumping. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recap the morning's news, politics and global affairs with the Breakfast Wrap.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
