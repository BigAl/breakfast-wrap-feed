      <title>Breakfast Wrap: The MP challenging the Nationals Leadership</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Coverage and analysis of national and international events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Start each day with comprehensive coverage and analysis of national and international events, and hear interviews with the people who matter today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nationals backbencher Colin Boyce said he will move a spill motion to challenge David Littleproud for the leadership of the party next week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr Littleproud says he's &quot;always respected&quot; the party room's &quot;decisions and direction&quot;, including &quot;the right to voice different opinions&quot; - and he stands by his record as Nationals leader. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, pressure on Opposition Leader Sussan Ley has intensified.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two most likely leadership contenders - Andrew Hastie and Angus Taylor - aren't ruling out a tilt ahead of parliament resuming next week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Turning to WA where authorities have confirmed they're investigating the alleged throwing of a bomb into a crowd at an Invasion Day rally in Perth as a &quot;potential terrorist act&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 31-year old man has been charged with endangering lives or safety, and he's also been charged with making or possessing explosives under suspicious circumstances in connection with the Australia Day incident.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overseas US President Donald Trump has signalled he wants to ease tensions in Minneapolis following the fatal shooting of American citizen Alex Pretti.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The killing of Mr Pretti has reignited local protests in Minneapolis and across the country, and comes just weeks after Renee Good was killed by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement official in the same city.Meanwhile a former senior lawyer says the latest investigation into the Minnesota governor and Minneapolis mayor is about shifting the focus of the events. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Breakfast Wrap: Former ICE director questions agency's response</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;US President Donald Trump says he wants an &quot;honourable and honest&quot; investigation into the killing of protester Alex Pretti by federal agents in Minneapolis. Mr Trump's so-called &quot;border tsar&quot; Tom Homan has arrived in Minneapolis to lead the immigration crackdown, replacing Border Patrol commander Gregory Bovino. The Breakfast Wrap speaks to a former director of ICE.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, former Prime Minister Scott Morrison has urged Muslim leaders to accredit preachers, to translate religious teachings into English and to clamp down on links to foreign Islamist groups. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the program opposition front bencher Andrew Bragg supports the notion, saying that &quot;the Australian Muslim community has to take some responsibility for the behaviours we've seen exhibited over the last couple of decades&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And overseas, the political fallout continues in the UK, after former British home secretary Suella Braverman became the latest MP to defect from the Conservatives to join Nigel Farage's Reform UK party this week.Recap the morning's news, politics and global affairs with the Breakfast Wrap.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Breakfast Wrap: Final hostage remains return to Israel</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The remains of the last Israeli hostage in Gaza are returned home, paving the way for progress on the US plan for the enclave. We hear from a former Israeli hostage negotiator turned peace activist. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, the dramatic end to the federal Liberal-National Coalition has the potential to reshape right-wing politics in Australia. While some are still working to get the Coalition back together, others say the break-up could lead to new opportunities for both parties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile we talk soaring temperatures, the energy grid and the Adelaide Writer's Festival with the South Australian Premier Peter Malinauskas. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And anti-vaping advocates say they have a program that could prevent problematic gambling behaviours in teenagers and young adults, and they're calling on the federal government to get behind it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recap the morning's news, politics and global affairs with the Breakfast Wrap.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There have been renewed protests and clashes with law enforcement in Minneapolis, after a man was shot dead by federal agents at the weekend. We hear from a Democratic State Senator as calls grow for ICE to leave the state. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Members of the federal Liberal and National parties have spent the weekend assessing the implications following another Coalition divorce. Deputy leader Ted O'Brien come on the program to back up his leader Sussan Ley. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And the Young Australian of the Year Nedd Brockman shares his vision to tackle homelessness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recap the morning's news, politics and global affairs with the Breakfast Wrap.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Breakfast Wrap: What is the future of NATO?</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Many are trying to gauge the future of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, so we're featuring two different perspectives. A former deputy NATO commander, and a former US envoy, who have different takes on the future of American involvement and what middle powers should be doing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then we'll dive back into federal politics and the split between the Nationals and Liberal party. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recap the morning's news, politics and global affairs with the Breakfast Wrap.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Former Nationals leader and One Nation convert is our guest. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, US President Donald Trump is dropping plans to add a 10 per cent tariff on goods from eight European countries over their opposition to his push to acquire Greenland. Treasurer Jim Chalmers shares the government's reaction. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recap the morning's news, politics and global affairs with the Breakfast Wrap.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The government's gun law reforms passed parliament yesterday, receiving support in the Senate from the Greens, while its hate laws passed with the support of the Liberal party.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having failed to settle a joint position on the legislation, the Nationals opposed it when it reached the senate. We hear from the Government and the Greens. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then an interview with the Chief of the Norwegian Defence Force, as Washington continues to push for a takeover of Greenland. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NATO military leaders are preparing for a scheduled meeting in Brussels this week, right as Denmark calls for a NATO mission in Greenland. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And we speak with the British politician pushing for the UK to adopt an Australian-style social media ban for under-16s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recap the morning's news, politics and global affairs with the Breakfast Wrap.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
