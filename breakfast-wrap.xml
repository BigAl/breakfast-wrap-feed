      <title>Breakfast Wrap: Key Liberal wants 'apology tour' to end</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Liberal Party needs to end its post-election &quot;apology tour&quot; and &quot;mass therapy session&quot;, according to one of its most senior frontbenchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a wide-ranging speech last night, Shadow Finance Minister James Paterson warned that his party could face destruction if it adopts a Nigel Farage-style populist agenda. But Mr Paterson also rejected suggestions the Liberals should position themselves as free market teals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, an Arab-Israeli member of the Knesset worries that far-right politicians will justify returning to war in Gaza based on Hamas delays in returning Israeli hostage bodies. We hear from Aida Touma-Sliman. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also today, we look at Oral history. Its considered the world's oldest form of sharing knowledge and culture, and in Australia, Aboriginal people have been sharing stories this way for thousands of years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this week, former prime minister Tony Abbott launched a new book tracing the history of Australia and questioned the reliability of oral history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In response, Yorta Yorta man and chair of the First Nations Foundation, Ian Hamm, says &quot;substance and an accurate record of events&quot; are at the centre of oral history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And in the wake of the algal bloom outbreak in South Australian waters, the state and federal governments are contributing more than $100 million to spruik this message.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recap the morning's news, politics and global affairs with the Breakfast Wrap.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Breakfast Wrap: Tony Abbott on multiculturalism and Indigenous oral history</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In a wide-ranging interview, Australia's 28th Prime Minister Tony Abbott discusses Australian history, Indigenous Australian oral storytelling, multiculturalism and former PM Julia Gillard's famous misogyny speech. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He shares his thoughts as he releases a new book exploring how democracy took shape in Australia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, Qantas says customer data has been released after almost six million customer records were stolen by a hacking group earlier this year through a third-party platform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The airline says it's investigating what data has been released with the help of specialist cyber-security experts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And today, Israeli hostages and hundreds of Palestinians imprisoned by Israel will be swapped in the first phase of Donald Trump's plan for Gaza...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So how did this plan come about?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A veteran Israeli negotiator involved in the backroom dealings on this agreement will share his insights. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recap the morning's news, politics and global affairs with the Breakfast Wrap.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Breakfast Wrap: Optus blame game explained</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Who knew what... and when... about the Optus triple zero outage? Those are the key questions asked this week in parliament following the disastrous outage linked to three deaths. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We'll get clarity on the timeline, and hear from the federal government. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, the French President says he will name a new prime minister in the next 48 hours. Yet he's still under pressure to follow his ex-Prime Minister out the door too. One of his Renaissance party colleagues joins us. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Queensland, mining giant Glencore has accepted a $600 million support package from the state and federal governments to save its ailing sites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And we'll find out why an Australian has been hit with a 14 year prison sentence in absentia by Russia, over his role fighting in the war in Ukraine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recap the morning's news, politics and global affairs with the Breakfast Wrap.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

We get a response to the situation from the federal government. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And Deputy Prime Minister Richard Marles touts news that Papua New Guinea's cabinet has approved a landmark defence treaty with Australia, after the two countries failed to sign the agreement last month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recap the morning's news, politics and global affairs with the Breakfast Wrap.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Breakfast Wrap: What is the impact of the US government shutdown?</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;It's day one of a government shutdown in the United States, and hundreds of thousands of federal workers are bracing for missed paychecks,  while government operations grind to a halt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro says he's ready to declare a state of emergency amid reports the US military is drawing up options to target drug traffickers inside Venezuela. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, California has signed a new bill into law requiring top AI companies to fulfil transparency requirements and report AI-related safety incidents. So could and should Australia follow suit? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And a Senate inquiry into aged care has called for an end to the &quot;rationing&quot; of home care packages, and the urgent release of more to ensure Australians aren't dying while waiting. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recap the morning's news, politics and global affairs with the Breakfast Wrap.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Breakfast Wrap: What the latest housing scheme means for house prices?</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Has it just got easier or harder to get into the property market?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The federal government's Home Guarantee Scheme is expanding today, meaning more Australians will only need to pay a five per cent deposit on a property.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the changes, there will be no income limits, meaning all first-time buyers are eligible. But it comes as new figures show eight months of consistent property price growth, so will this new scheme encourage that trend? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, we're once again talking about a government shutdown in the United States - so why is this the system that Washington has to navigate? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And we'll look at a proposed merger between two of the country's largest media companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recap the morning's news, politics and global affairs with the Breakfast Wrap.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Breakfast Wrap: Is Trump's Gaza proposal a plan for peace?</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The White House has released a 20-point plan to end the ongoing war in Gaza, but is it a plan for peace?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You'll hear from the ABC's John Lyons, and two different Palestinian perspectives - Palestinian politician Mustafa Barghouthi and Gazan-American analyst Ahmed Fouad Alkhatib.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, a number of unregulated melatonin products sold in Australia have been found to be 400 per cent stronger than advertised,  while some had no active melatonin at all. So what's the warning to melatonin users?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And local artists, authors, and creatives are gathering at Parliament House today to speak out about the impact of artificial intelligence. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recap the morning's news, politics and global affairs with the Breakfast Wrap.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Breakfast Wrap: Australia's role in the space race</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Australia is the centre of the known universe this week, as world leaders in space development and research meet in Sydney for the annual International Astronautical Congress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new space race has begun, with billionaires Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos leading the way and the Australian government encouraging local industry to get involved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, confusion remains about exactly how many Australian companies will be impacted by looming US pharmaceutical tariffs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week the US President announced that from October, the US will impose a 100 per cent tariff on branded or patented pharmaceutical imports, unless a pharmaceutical company builds a manufacturing plant in the US - so what could it mean for Australian industry?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And the Prime Minister has wrapped up a visit to the UK with an address to the Labour party conference in Liverpool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the speech, Mr Albanese vowed to defend democracy itself while standing alongside the man he described as his &quot;mate&quot;: British PM Sir Keir Starmer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It comes after the Australian PM leaned into the comfort of the Commonwealth, enjoying lunch with King Charles at Balmoral Castle in Scotland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recap the morning's news, politics and global affairs with the Breakfast Wrap.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
